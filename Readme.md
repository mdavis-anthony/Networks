Part A Instructions:

Hello! For this part, you will be running a standard TCP and UDP connection using python programming language.

To get started:

- Unzip the downloaded file and if need be, put it in the desired location on your device

- open up editor/IDE of your choice and open the files within the Part_A folder.

- Once files are open, open a terminal , direct to the the where the TCP-server.py file is located and run the following command:

  - "python3 TCP-Server.py" -> this should make a prompt stating that "the server is ready to receive"

  - Next, run the client side from the same location: "python3 TCP-client.py"

  - Once prompted to input a lowercase, the server should sent over a message providing the same message, but in uppercase. 

    (The same process is the same for UDP-client.py and UDP.server.py)
